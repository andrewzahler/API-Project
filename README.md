# Wildfire
## Visualizing Twitter via Google Maps
[Wildfire](https://andrewzahler.github.io/API-Project/) is an app that lets users find out what people are talking about in a specific region of the United States by displaying top Twitter trends on a map.

### Motivation Behind the App
**Social media keeps connected and in the know.** But with newsfeeds curated by algorithms, we often find ourselves in the echo chambers of a like-minded bubble.

**On Twitter, a message can reach the world in minutes,** but the scrolling news feed is one-dimensional design. We aim to challenge the chronological model and illustrate the global flow of ideas across in real time.

### Product Description
Combining the Twitter API and the Google Maps API, our product visualizes where tweets occur, creating a compelling new way to consume information and escape geographic and social boundaries.

### Version 1.0
This version of Wildfire communicates the top trending Twitter topics in over 60 U.S. cities by plotting them on a Google Map.

### Looking Ahead
* We hope to take the following steps to improve Wildfire.
* Add OAuth implementation to sign in users and get live data from Twitter.
* Make map circles clickable. Display the #hashtag and tweet volume on each bubble.  
* Populate the map more frequently.
* Plot more than one trending topic per city on map.
* Access city coordinates via API instead of baking them in.
