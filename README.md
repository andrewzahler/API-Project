# API-Project
This app lets users find out what people are talking about in a specific region of the United States by displaying top Twitter trends on a map.

Motivation
On Twitter, a message can reach the world in minutes, but the platform's design can feel one-dimensional. We wanted to challenge the chronological model and illustrate the flow of ideas across the world in real time.

Description
Our product takes Twitter data and enhances it through visualization, creating a compelling new way to consume information and allowing users to escape geographic boundaries.

Results
Our proof of concept app communicates the top trending Twitter topics in over 60 U.S. cities by plotting them on a Google Map. We want to expand our idea to cover the world and update with new trending topics in close to real time.
